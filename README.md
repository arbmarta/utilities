**meta_wri_chm_gee_exporter.js**: This code provides an export for the Tolan et al. (2024) canopy height model dataset for use in Google Earth Engine. It is a simple addition to their own code (https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/meta_trees/). Limit the export area using an area drawn in Google Earth Engine and labeled "geometry"

**meta_wri_chm_v2_boto3_exporter.py**: This code helps you explore the forests/v2 directory that houses the version 2 canopy height model dataset from Meta and WRI (Tolan et al., 2024).
